# AI Tool Database

AI is evolving rapidly, with new tools being released and updated constantly. Because of this, it’s hard to pinpoint a single “best” tool since the landscape is always changing. Instead, focus on your specific needs, whether it’s writing, brainstorming, or something else choose tools that align with those tasks.

## **My Go-To AI Tools**
I rely on the following tools for **90%** of my tasks:

1. **ChatGPT**: Powerful, versatile, and easy to use.

2. **Perplexity**: Great for finding relevant information on the internet. However, I’m increasingly using ChatGPT’s search feature for this as well.

```


3. **NotebookLM**: Minimal hallucinations, file-based knowledge, and unique features like free AI podcast generation.

```{admonition} Personal Note
:class: note
I pay for ChatGPT Pro, but there are plenty of great free options out there too. The real key isn’t which tool you use, but how well you use it. 

Knowing how to ask the right questions and understanding what these models can and can’t do makes all the difference. Refer back to [LLMs Explained](llms_explained.md) to really understand how these systems work.
